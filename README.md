This repository contains a collection of C++ programs and exercises for learning and practicing C++ syntax, concepts, and problem-solving.

## Structure

- `IGN/` — Reference programs and examples from IGN coursework.
- `.vscode/` — VS Code configuration for building and debugging.

## Getting Started

1. **Open in VS Code** (recommended for best experience).
2. **Build and run** any `.cpp` file using the default build task (`Ctrl+Shift+B`).
3. **Explore** the examples and modify or add your own programs!

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (dev container)
- g++ or clang (configured in `.vscode/tasks.json` and `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`)

## Example

To compile and run a file:
```sh
g++ codedex/fizz_buzz.cpp -o fizz_buzz && ./fizz_buzz
```

Happy coding!
